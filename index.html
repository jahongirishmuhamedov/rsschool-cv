    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>Currently I'm a student of Cambridge International University and my major is Information technology. In the
        first year of the university subjects such as Web programming, Project Management, Cyber security, Database
        systems, Mobile programming, Using Social Media in Business were studied. <br>

        In addition, due to my interest in the Frontend direction of programming, it has been studied independently
        since 2021,
        and to date, several small projects have also been completed (available on the git hub account). In addition to
        programming, I am interested in personal development and work on myself to try to correct shortcomings. <br>

        For the next 5 years, I want to gain in-depth knowledge in the field and get a job in one of the top companies
        in
        Uzbekistan, increase my experience, gather experienced programmers and start my own projects and business.
